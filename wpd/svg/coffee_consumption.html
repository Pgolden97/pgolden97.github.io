        <p>In this page, we use a single svg graphic. Unlike images, svg is a graphic created purely by code and is a scaleable vector graphic meaning that the image resizes  with the size and resolution of our window. In our case we are using media quereys that allow the svg to change depending on window size by setting parameters that will rearange and change the SVG. As you move the window to be smaller, you notice that at a specific point the image will completly change to better suit the size of the window and vice versa. SVG images are great because they allow varying size distrubution without distortion and pixelation. SVG files can be created online with svg makers like svg edit and I am pretty sure you can create them with photoshop. SVG is benefitial because the code is stored instead of a image being hosted on a server and having to be pulled down therfore svg are often faster to load on pages and extremly high resolution. </p>
